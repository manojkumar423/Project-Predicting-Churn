Project Predicting Churn User

This Project is based on the prediction of Churn user or customer attrition that tells us that a customer is going to be churn in near future. In this project we include several machine learning Algorithms models to show that which model have better accuracy rate. Due to the customer attrition Telecommunication company suffers a loss of 30 - 40 % So, it is important for them to know when the customer is going to ditch the company so that then act according to it and what are the main reason that this thing is happening. So that the Decision Making can become more effective and the company can make effective decision With the help of Advancing technology like python, we perform Exploratory Data analysis on the data and understand it with Data Visualization and with Machine Learning implementation of models is concluded and also, we able to find the key points affecting the user to churn.

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
